To get Power spheres from 2009c 1mm space to standard 6th gen MNI152 2mm space:


3dresample -master [file path to 2mm MNI 6th gen] -prefix power_drysdale_spheres_mni125_2mm.nii -input power_drysdale_spheres.nii

>> output is power_drysdale_spheres_mni125_2mm.nii
>> "master" is the voxel size it will match to
